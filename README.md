## spotigram

To use the application, simply unzip the spotigram.zip file from releases, and start the application for your operating system. Spotigram will guide you through the set up process as you go.

If you are using macOS and the app won't work, try running this in terminal: 

`chmod +x /path/to/spotigram-macos`



To run this in a development environment, clone this repo, run `npm install`, then run `node spotigram.js`

## What's new?

1.) A new web interface for instructions on how to set up everything Spotify related

2.) You no longer have to write Instagram credentials into config.json, the app will ask for them each time you start up the app. This is to decrease security risks of having your password stored in a plain text file.

3.) The app is more efficient and user-friendly (hopefully)

4.) Complete rewrite of v1, v1 is now a public archive, don't use it lol.
