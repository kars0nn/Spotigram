## spotigram

!Notice: Until I get a CA server set up, the exe will be unsigned, which means windows will tell you it "protected your pc," this isn't anything bad. It just means that it couldn't find a certificate, you can click "More Info" and then "Run anyway"

To use the application, simply unzip the spotigram.zip file from releases, and start the application for your operating system. Spotigram will do everything for you, you just have to allow Spotigram access.

If you are using macOS and the app won't work, try running this in terminal: 

`chmod +x /path/to/spotigram-macos`



To run this in a development environment:

1.) clone this repo

2.) add your spotify client into the code, also make sure to change deployPath with __dirname

3.) run `npm install` EDIT: You need to install each dependency in command line, package.json doesn't do its job

4.) run `node spotigram.js`

5.) If there's an error, please let me know on Discord (karson#7362)
